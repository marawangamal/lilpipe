# Experiment notes

Run commands from `examples/tamper-resistance`.

## TAR and SAM relearning trajectories

The existing `configs/experiments/z7b-wmdp-bio-relearn-128--5pp.yml` includes
matching attacks on MaxEnt + TAR K=16 and MaxEnt + SAM (`rho=1e-2`). Select
only their `--relearn-fft-lr5e-6-ms128` model IDs for this comparison. Both
use 128 optimizer steps, an initial learning rate of `5e-6` with linear decay,
microbatch size 1, gradient accumulation 1, training seed 1, and data seed 42.

Save model-only checkpoints every 16 steps and keep all eight checkpoints
(16 through 128); use the original defended model for step 0. Preserve these
weights for later projection onto the seeded loss-landscape directions and
contour trajectory plots. The manifest evaluates WMDP-Bio robust and
MMLU-no-bio at steps 0, 16, ..., 128 after each attack succeeds. No cleanup
is scheduled.

From the example root, inspect the planned commands before submission:

```bash
tar_model=z7b-wmdp-bio--5pp--unlearn-fft-me-tar-k16--relearn-fft-lr5e-6-ms128
sam_model=z7b-wmdp-bio--5pp--unlearn-fft-me-sam-rho1e-2--relearn-fft-lr5e-6-ms128

lilpipe configs/experiments/z7b-wmdp-bio-relearn-128--5pp.yml \
  --models "$tar_model" "$sam_model" \
  --sbatch-args='--partition=gpubase_bynode_b1' \
  --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` to submit. Before submission, check that the canonical
output paths are absent or already contain the intended complete trajectories;
reuse complete outputs rather than overwriting them. If rerunning an attack
whose evaluation directory already exists, move that directory into
`artifacts/tamia/evals/archive/` before submission so old and new results
are never mixed.

## TODO: Gaussian pre-relearning attack

After the queued 1,000-step SEAM trajectories finish, run a separate 250-step
attack sweep that adds an independent parameter delta
$\delta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ before ordinary relearning. Use
`trainers.rl_perturb.GaussianBF16Trainer`, a fixed `gaussian_seed`, and sweep
`gaussian_sigma`. The trainer writes the perturbed model to `checkpoint-0`, so
evaluate that checkpoint before checkpoints 10 through 250. Keep attacks
serialized as attack, evaluate every retained checkpoint, cleanup, then start
the next setting. Retain 26 checkpoints so step 0 and all 25 ten-step attack
checkpoints survive rotation. Record `gaussian_sigma` and `gaussian_seed` in
every evaluation summary. Do not include this sweep in the 1,000-step
experiment.

## Results

### BeaverTails legacy SEAM reproducibility

The legacy trainer computes global BF16 gradient norms by iterating over a
Python set in `gradient_dict_dot`. Consequently, `seed: 42` does not fully
specify the defense: the process-level `PYTHONHASHSEED` changes the reduction
order and can send training into a different basin. Pin `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`
when launching the legacy defense. A follow-up that retained this order but
promoted the accumulation to FP32 did not reproduce self-destruction, so the
canonical reproduction retains the authors' BF16 accumulation.

Under the disjoint relearning attack with learning rate `1e-4`, the newly
trained hash-0 checkpoint reproduces the historical self-destruction:

| Defense | Step | Harmfulness | Capability |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Historical legacy | 0 | 4.30 | 55.84 |
| Historical legacy | 100 | 0.28 | 25.74 |
| Historical legacy | 200 | 0.19 | 25.68 |
| Clean canonical rerun | 0 | 4.62 | 55.78 |
| Clean canonical rerun | 100 | 0.34 | 25.70 |
| Clean canonical rerun | 200 | 0.34 | 25.63 |
| FP32 accumulation | 0 | 4.62 | 55.78 |
| FP32 accumulation | 100 | 72.90 | 54.23 |
| FP32 accumulation | 200 | 74.89 | 53.82 |

Generate the regular and alignment attack trajectories from the example root:

```bash
python scripts/analysis/plot_trajectory_wmdp.py --plot main
python scripts/analysis/plot_trajectory_beavertails.py --plot main
```

The scripts write PDF and PNG figures to `artifacts/figures`.

### Hyperparameter sweeps

The table records the Zephyr-7B sweeps by unlearning-method family. Each named
stage in `sweep.yml` is an independent grid; only parameters within the same
stage form a Cartesian product. Other settings were inherited from the method's
`base.yml`; promoted values are recorded in `selected.yml`.

The first grid's pick (grid--018) was retired: epsilon <= 1e-2 rounds away in bf16, so its SEAM term was noise and the model was effectively GD |

GD + AO inherited the promoted GD learning rate and forget coefficient, then
used six independent sweep stages in one manifest. The canonical relearning learning-rate sweep
tested `{2.5e-6, 5e-6, 7.5e-6, 1e-5}` before promoting `1e-5` for the 125-step
long attack. RMU + AO keeps the promoted RMU settings and trainable layers
fixed, targets AO at layers 5--7, and varies only the AO coefficient.

RMU + AO selected the strongest positive AO candidate satisfying a maximum
2-point MMLU drop from the 58.59 base-model score:

| $\lambda_{\mathrm{AO}}$ | WMDP-Bio robust $\downarrow$ | MMLU-no-bio $\uparrow$ | MMLU drop | Eligible |

| 0 | 27.65 | 56.72 | 1.87 | yes |

#### MiniCPM5-1B

The MiniCPM5-1B sweep is planned but has not been run. RMU candidates follow
the original RMU search dimensions and should be evaluated in stages rather
than as one Cartesian product. All non-RMU method families remain unspecified.

The MiniCPM5-1B GD study minimizes pre-attack WMDP-Bio robust accuracy subject
to MMLU-no-bio accuracy remaining at least `0.5062` (at most a two-point drop
from the base model). Trial 11 was promoted with WMDP-Bio `0.47350` and MMLU
`0.52920`. Trials reaching near-random WMDP accuracy were ineligible because
their MMLU accuracy collapsed to approximately `0.23`.
